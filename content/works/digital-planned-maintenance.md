In this project, I was responsible for developing a digital planned maintenance system for Unilever Skin Factory in Cikarang, Indonesia. The system was built using PHP and Codeigniter for the backend, and Flutter for the frontend. The system was designed to help the maintenance team plan and execute maintenance tasks more efficiently.
